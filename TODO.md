Small things:
* Add time added to columns
* Sortable columns

Slightly harder:
* Dropdown style menu for adding threads/rechecking all/admin login
* Make last checked show hours/minutes/seconds
* Timezones
* Parse messages/users/emails and have them in the DB (instead of just copying the raw html from 4chan)

Near future:
* AJAX everything up
* Extension/plugin support or something to support more chans
* Make admin login tied to database
* Install/upgrade script?
